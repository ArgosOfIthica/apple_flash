<div id="ueb1">Live CD on an USB Stick (32-bit EFI, 64-bit Linux)</div>
A friend of mine is using his old MacBook Pro from the year 2006 up to this date (December 2019).
Unfortunately he gets an error message from his banking website, that his Firefox browser is to
old and a security risk. It is actually the only website, that is complaining. I like the idea
of protecting the environment by using everything quite long (last MacBook Pro of mine was 2010-2018,
current is a used one from 2012).<br><br>
One idea was to give him another more up to date browser for his
MacOS X Lion, but nothing worked. Then I though about
using an Live CD. But the newest, that I was able to boot and had lying around was Ubuntu
12.04. I burned quite a lot
DVDs but I did not recognize that his DVD drive stopped working along the way. Then
after some reading on 
<a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/" target="_blank">the reFind website</a> I figured
out, that everything is related to the 32-bit EFI bootloader, that is needed. The Linux
itself can then be a 64-bit version.<br><br>
Then I stumbled across the website of
<a href="https://mattgadient.com/linux-dvd-images-and-how-to-for-32-bit-efi-macs-late-2006-models/" target="_blank">
Matt Gadient</a>. He offered
some Linux images, that are 64-bit versions but a few bytes in the bootloader are changed,
so that the old Macs grab the 32-bit EFI loader. To quote him on the Mac models:
<div id="ueb2">Before reading further: Make sure you’re in the same boat!</div>
These tend to be all of the Core2Duo models from late 2006. More specifically:
<li>iMac 5,1 – iMac 5,2 – iMac 6,1
</li><li>Macbook 2,1
</li><li>MacBook Pro 2,1 – MacBook Pro 2,2
</li><li>Mac Pro 1,1
</li><li>Xserve 1,1 (maybe)<br><br>
Matts page is quite long - especially caused by comments. To sum it up: The broken DVD drive
seems to be quite common. Matt mostly suggests using an external CD drive or to remove the 
harddisk, install a Linux with another PC on it and put it back. But then I found one
really interesting comment, that mainly consisted of a link to a very cryptic PDF on how
to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/toysbox/files/MacBook_revival_Playground/Booting_any_ubuntu_on_MacBook-32bit_and_windows10-like_uefi_using_usb_stick.pdf" target="_blank">
boot these Macs with a USB Live Linux Stick</a>.
After a lot of hours I found a reproduceable way to make such a stick in just 10 minutes.
I tested it with <code>
lubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64-mac-mattgadient.com.iso
</code>
which worked very good and with some Manjaro, which didn't work. So, here are the steps ...
<br><br>
- Grab a USB stick that is not to cheap, otherwise you might end with an error like this:
<img src="Live%20CD%20on%20an%20USB%20Stick%20(32-bit%20EFI,%2064-bit%20Linux)_files/efi32boot1.jpg">
- Start a Linux distro of your choice (e.g. Manjaro 18.1.3) on another PC<br>
- Start a terminal and type
<div id="code">
lsblk
</div>
- Plug in your USB stick without any important data (All will be lost!) and type
<div id="code">
lsblk
</div>
again and compare it to the last output. The difference between the outputs are caused by
the newly inserted stick. Mine is called <code><b>sdb</b></code>
and so all the following commands are based on that expression. <br><br>
It is <span id="mark">extremly (!) important</span>, that you alter all of my commands
written here appropriately if you have another drive expression than
<code><b>sdb</b></code> to not accidently overwrite your other sticks and harddrives
currently installed!
<br><br>

- Start a Terminal and type:<br>
<div id="code">
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<b>sdb</b>
</div>
and quit this process after about 10 seconds by pressing Ctrl+C a few times. This process
completely erases all partitions and the boot-record on the stick.<br><br>


- Now we have to give the whole stick the "Master Boot Record" (<code>MBR/msdos</code>)
format:
<div id="code">
sudo fdisk /dev/<b>sdb</b>      <br>
o                               <br>
w                               <br>
</div> 

- Next we are going to put a small EFI boot partition on the stick:
<div id="code">
sudo fdisk /dev/<b>sdb</b>        <br> 
n                                 <br>
p                                 <br>
1                                 <br>
2048                              <br>
+36M                              <br>
w                                 <br>
</div>


Now think about for a short while: What will be the largest Linux Live ISO, that you
will put on this stick. I will only use Lubuntu, which is about 1.1 GB, so (on
my small 2 GB stick) 1700MB is enough for me. If you want more space and have a
larger Stick you might want to replace the 1700 in the next section.
<br><br>
- We are going to change the first partition to a real EFI-boot partition and make another
partition for the Lubuntu:
<div id="code">
sudo fdisk /dev/<b>sdb</b>           <br>
t                                    <br>
ef                                   <br>
n                                    <br>
p                                    <br>
2                                    <br>
75776                                <br>
+1700M                               <br>
a                                    <br>
1                                    <br>
w                                    <br>
</div>

- Start the Programm GParted <br>
- Click GParted - Refresh devices <br>
- Click GParted - Devices - /dev/<b>sdb</b> <br>
- Right-click first partition - Format as - FAT32 <br>
- Click on the "Apply all operations" checkmark <br>
<br>
- We have to mount the drive manually, because Linux does not mount the EFI partition
type automatically:
<div id="code">
mkdir /tmp/sdb1                                <br>
sudo mount -o rw /dev/<b>sdb</b>1 /tmp/sdb1    <br>
</div>

- The fastest way to create some nested folders:
<div id="code">
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/sdb1/boot/grub/        <br>
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/sdb1/efi/boot/         <br>
</div>

- Now we tell the GRUB bootloader to search for the <code>loopback.cfg</code> which will start the
real Linux kernel:
<div id="code">
sudo nano /tmp/sdb1/boot/grub/grub.cfg
</div>
- Copy the following lines into the nano-editor, that just opened:
<div id="code">
search --file --set=root /boot/grub/loopback.cfg   <br>
configfile /boot/grub/loopback.cfg                 <br>
</div>
- Now quit it with Ctrl+X and write changes. <br>
- Download <a href="https://github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta/blob/master/boot/bootia32.efi" target="_blank">
https://github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta/blob/master/boot/bootia32.efi</a> <br>
manually or <code>wget https://github.com/jfwells/linux-asus-t100ta/raw/master/boot/bootia32.efi</code><br>
- Copy this file from your download folder and unmount the drive: 
<div id="code">
sudo cp /home/stefan/Downloads/bootia32.efi /tmp/sdb1/efi/boot/ <br>
sync                                                            <br>
sudo umount /tmp/sdb1                                           <br>
</div>
- Put the ISO image on the second partition of the stick: 
<div id="code">
sudo dd if=/path/to/lubuntu.iso of=/dev/<b>sdb</b>2 bs=1M
</div>

<div id="ueb2">Testing the Stick</div>
- Put it into the USB of the old Mac<br>
- Switch it on with the Power button and immediately afterwards, press and hold the
Alt-Key until 2 drives appear on a grey screen<br>
- Select the EFI and press Enter<br>
- Now it takes a minute until a menu appears with "Try Ubuntu ..." - Press the
key <span id="mark">&nbsp;e&nbsp;<br></span>
- A very basic editor opens with 2 important words on the screen: <code>quiet splash</code><br>
These are bootoptions. There are lots of them and using a search machine should reveal a
site, that is as helpfull as my <a href="https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bootoptionen/" target="_blank">
german page</a>. Most of the times I used:
<div id="code">
quiet nomodeset nosplash
</div>
If you have plenty of ram (&gt;=3 GB) you could load the whole stick to RAM and eject the
stick it after the Linux has started:
<div id="code">
quiet nomodeset toram nosplash
</div>
- Press fn+F10<br>
- Wait for some minutes<br>

<div id="ueb2">Some hints for Installing the Linux</div>
I have never tried to actually install the Linux but at least
3 people succeeded. To sum up important conclusions from the comments:<br>
- Kim mentions, that it is very important to have a
working LAN connection to install updates during install.
A USB network adapter is useful here.
